                <h2>Education Reforms in Ghana</h2>
                <p>The Ghana Education Reform Agenda
                    The Government of Ghana initiated some key education reforms to transform teaching and learning and improve educational outcomes under the Education Strategic Plan (ESP 2018-2030) which was approved by cabinet in November 2018. These reforms are expected to contribute to the goals of the ESP and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 4) and lead to the improvement of learning outcomes, especially at the pre-tertiary levels. The three main priorities of the education reforms are: Improved learning outcomes, enhanced accountability and equity at all levels of the education sector.
                    
                    The main objective for embarking on these key reforms is to make our educational system relevant to changing national development priorities and renewed goals and aspirations.  It is also to ensure that our educational system adjusts to context and time; as well as advancement in technologies, industry, creativity and knowledge economy. These new reform initiatives exist to provide clear performance standards to guide teaching, learning, assessment and grading of students. The reforms will professionalize teaching and ensure standards. </p>

                <h2>STEM Education Growth</h2>
                <p>The global demand for STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education has increased significantly recently. Ghana is one of the African countries that have recognised the importance of encouraging innovation and excellence in STEM sectors. As a result, various institutions nationwide have emerged as leaders in providing high-quality STEM education.STEM education in Ghana is undergoing a transformative phase, fueled by investments and innovative programs aimed at equipping students with critical skills for the future. The government has focused on building infrastructure such as the Accra STEM Academy and 20 STEM centers, with plans to extend these resources nationwide. These facilities offer advanced tools for studying fields like artificial intelligence, robotics, and biotechnology, fostering a hands-on, inquiry-based learning environment.

                    The Basic STEM (BSTEM) initiative introduces STEM subjects at the foundational education level. By providing robotics kits, programming tools, and STEM training for teachers, it seeks to cultivate an interest in technology and science among young learners. This effort includes resources for over 4,400 schools and extensive teacher training, ensuring inclusivity and bridging gaps in education access.</p>

                <h2>New University Rankings</h2>
                <p>The University of Ghana, in the 75th year since its establishment, has once again emerged as the leading tertiary institution in Ghana and the sole Ghanaian university in the 2023 edition of the Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU), commonly referred to as the Shanghai Ranking.

                    This latest ranking reinforces the University's position as the foremost university in the country, a distinction the University earned after the release of the 2023 Center for World University Rankings (CWUR) in May 2023.
                    
                    According to the ranking, the University holds the first position in Ghana and is placed among the best 18 universities from various African countries, including Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana, South Africa, and Tunisia. The University falls within the rank range of 901-1000, sharing this range with institutions such as the University of South Africa, the University of Sfax in Tunisia, and Beni-Suef University in Egypt.
                    
                    In addition to the University's outstanding overall performance, specific subject areas were considered for ranking, including Mathematics, Computer Science & Engineering, Biotechnology, Agricultural Sciences, Medicine, and Pharmacy. Among these, Public Health emerged as the best-ranked subject at the University.
                    
                    This recognition of the University of Ghana in the 2023 rankings stands as a testament to the University's dedication to its mission of creating an enabling environment that makes the University of Ghana increasingly relevant to national and global development through cutting-edge research and high-quality teaching and learning.</p>

                <h2>Improving Literacy Rates</h2>
                <p>in many developing countries, especially those in rural, remote, and deprived communities 
                    where government resources do not reach all and as a result are unable to provide learning 
                    resources that could benefit children in schools in those areas. The introduction of unlocking 
                    literacy (UL) and reading camps (RC) in rural, deprived, and remote parts of the country has 
                    been an important means to improve children’s literacy in schools and communities in selected 
                    communities. The study aimed at investigating how the UL strategies being implemented in 
                    schools and RCs improve children’s literacy development in the participating communities. 
                    The study also investigated efforts that have been made by community stakeholders towards 
                    the scalling up of the UL strategies to benefit communities that initially never had or 
                    implemented UL strategies. The study adopted a qualitative methodology. The data was 
                    gathered through interviews, focus group discussions, and observations in some RCs. 
                    Interviews were conducted for teachers, head teachers, ministry of education officials, 
                    community action core group members, RC facilitators, faith leaders, local government 
                    officials (assembly members), and parents whose children attend RCs. The results showed that 
                    the UL strategies are improving children’s literacy development. Most of the children 
                    benefiting from the UL feel confident in their reading, and have also improved on their overall 
                    academic performance. It was observed that the overall enrolment in schools with the 
                    participating communities have increased. It was observed that communities that initially never 
                    had UL being implemented in their schools and communities were making efforts to have 
                    UL/RCs to be introduced in their communities. However, in spite of the acceptability of the 
                    UL by community members, there are few challenges that are hampering the effective 
                    implementation of the UL strategies. This could also affect the smooth scaling up of the UL/RC 
                    project in the other parts of the country.</p>
