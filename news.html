                <h2>Ewando D/A School pupils endure snake bites, injuries, and academic disruptions due to poor infrastructure</h2>
                <p>Despite the 1992 Constitution's promise to provide quality education for all, Ewando D/A School, which caters to 320 pupils—including 60 in the Junior High School (JHS) section—is plagued by poor infrastructure, inadequate furniture, and dangerous conditions that regularly disrupt learning
                    Monica Donkor, a final-year student and Girls' Prefect, shared her frustrations: "When it rains at night, the roof leaks and the floors flood, making it impossible to concentrate during class. Sometimes, we don’t even meet for class three times a week, and this leaves us falling behind on our syllabus. We're supposed to be preparing for B.E.C.E., but it feels like we’re getting nowhere." 

The conditions also pose significant dangers. Pupils are often required to repair the school building themselves by gathering grass and sticks, exposing them to injury. Talon Yabicha Elliott, a Basic Six pupil, described their perilous task:  "We’ve been bitten by snakes and injured by cutlasses while trying to fix the building. It's a dangerous task for children our age." 

The lack of proper facilities has already caused serious incidents. During one repair effort, the thatched roof collapsed, injuring five students.  
Ewando D/A School’s plight is not unique. Across rural Ghana, schools face similar issues, including overcrowded classrooms, a lack of qualified teachers, and inadequate teaching materials. 

While Ghana remains committed to achieving the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 4—ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education for all—these systemic failures continue to hinder progress.  

For the children of Ewando D/A School, the absence of proper infrastructure undermines their academic performance and future opportunities. Their call for improved facilities and safe learning environments is a cry for justice for students in underserved areas nationwide.

                <h2>GCTU signs MoU for Microsoft IT certification programmes</h2>
                <p> In a strategic partnership aimed at enhancing digital skills and employability among Ghanaian students and professionals, GCTU has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Microsoft Skills for Jobs, Osoo Africa and Raycom Technologies.
                    The agreement, signed at a ceremony at GCTU, on Thursday, November 7, 2024, formalizes a collaboration that will bring the Microsoft Skills for Jobs Microdegree Programme to Ghana. This programme, funded by the European Union, will facilitate training, certification and job placement opportunities in high-demand areas like cybersecurity, artificial intelligence and coding.
                    The CEO of the Microsoft Skills for Jobs Microdegree programme, Mr. Sayed Jawed, echoed the enthusiasm for the partnership, revealing plans to expand the collaboration. “Early next year, we will bring a delegation from KAMK University, Finland and Microsoft to GCTU to explore affiliation agreements, potentially paving the way for student exchanges between Ghana and Finland,” Mr. Jawed said. The initiative aims to create pathways for Ghanaian students to gain international experience and for GCTU to host Finnish students, fostering cross-cultural learning.
                    The ceremony was attended by key officials from all partner organizations. Attendees from GCTU included the Registrar, Mr. Emmanuel Baidoo, Dean of the Faculty of Computing and Information Systems (FoCIS), Dr. William Lesley Brown-Acquaye and a lecturer at the Faculty of Engineering, Dr. Samuel Akwasi Danso.

                    The partners were represented by the CEO of Microsoft Skills for Jobs Microdegree Programme, Mr. Sayed Jawed, CEO of Osoo Africa, Maame Efua Essell and the Solution Consultant from Raycom Technologies, Mr. Ben Atitsogbui.
                    With this new alliance, GCTU is set to enhance its standing as an IT hub and a leader in digital education in Ghana</p>
